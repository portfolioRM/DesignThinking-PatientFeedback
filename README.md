## Project Summary:
For my “Foundations in Design Thinking” certificate I took 2 courses from IDEO U: *Insights for Innovation* and *From Ideas to Action*. For these classes I chose the following problem statement:<br><br>
***How might we provide better feedback tools/mechanisms for patients in a healthcare setting?***

I choose this topic because I have both heard stories from friends and experienced situations where I feel it is difficult to give feedback as a patient of healthcare services. Sometimes this can be as simple as a tip. Other times it can be either positive or negative thoughts we share with friends and family but never the hospital and providers. Currently, I work for a hospital. So, I see this issue from the viewpoint of the hospital system as well. I often think: *What valuable insights are being missed because this feedback falls through the cracks?*
<br><br>
## Steps Involved:
- Observing Patients
- Interviewing Patients
- Gaining Empathy for Patients
- Insights Garnered
- Ideating Solutions
- Prototyping Solutions
- Iterating to Refine Solutions
<br><br>
## Files Uploaded:
I have included a sample of the research for this project. 
1.	*"RashmiMariyappa__1_DesignThinking_Empathy"*<br>
This is the documentation of my patient empathy experience done as a customer journey map.<br><br>
2.	*"RashmiMariyappa_2_DesignThinking_Ideation"*<br>
These are presentation images that document the ideation session.<br><br>
3.	*"RashmiMariyappa_3_DesignThinking_Iteration"*<br>
These are presentation images that lay out the iterative next steps for prototyping, including evaluating the original prototypes through a desirability, feasibility, and viability lens.<br><br>
4.	*"RashmiMariyappa_4_DesignThinking_ThePitch"*<br>
This was the final pitch presentation summarizing our findings and next steps.
